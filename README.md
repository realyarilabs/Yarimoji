#### Emoji translator and picker

Simple and light Elm package with simple functions to translate ascii emojis to their unicode equivalent.
It also provides an emoji picker, so people can express themselves properly on your webapps.
Right now it only contains a few emojis, but don't worry There is more to come in the future!

**Still free to contribute with this package. We need tests and more emojis**

The proposal of this package is to add emojis to an web chat opensource make with
Elm and Elixir, promoted by [Yarilabs](http://www.yarilabs.com/).

The chat code links will be soon accessible to the public, and they'll be added to
this package.
